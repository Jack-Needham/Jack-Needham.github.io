 <li>Being an entrepreneur is the most sure way
     to make life-changing amounts of money. It is also the most effective way
     to have life-changing impact on the world.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Align your business to an industry or
     technology, one you believe will change the world. This is easier said
     than done. If you are too late, the winnings have been competed away. It
     is also easy to think you can revive a dying industry, you are probably
     wrong.  Picking wrong means you are always swimming upstream.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Most people are mimetic but like to think of
     themselves as contrarian. Recognise this and spend your time around true
     contrarian thinkers in industries that you are interested.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Over index on interestingness when starting
     a business. A few things come downstream of interest. First is good ideas.
     You are more likely to have a truly novel or contrarian idea in an
     industry you are naturally rummaging around in. Next is interest is a good
     forward indicator of grit. Finally, you will be more fulfilled. If you are
     going to spend a decade building something, do it about a problem you care
     about. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Interesting people don’t speak the most.
     They typically exist in non-conformist parts of the internet or academia.
     They will likely not be at mixers or “events”. If they are, they are
     usually quiet and not the centre of social groups. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Discipline is a competitive advantage
     directionally. Be disciplined at tasks that compound competitive
     advantages and increase momentum.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Timeframes are a competitive advantage. Most
     people overestimate what happens in a year and underestimate what happens
     in 10 years. Thinking in longer timeframes changes your decision-making
     frameworks and allows you to make better long-term bets. Most people
     aren’t competing in long-term games. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Momentum matters. That doesn’t mean it needs
     to be easy but you need to believe there is a route out of hardship and
     towards growth. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Ideas are abundant, not scarce. As a result,
     don’t be overly protective of ideas. Develop a framework of stress testing
     ideas to quickly understand their quality. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Action speaks louder than words. Don’t tell
     people you are great, show them.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Chips on shoulders lead to chips in pockets.
     </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Be competitive. Winning matters and you need
     to want it. Fuck participation medals.  </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Hard work is overrated. Most people aren’t
     honest with themselves about how productive they are in a day, spending
     time and energy on non-important tasks. Most people aren’t Elon Musk.
     Recognise this and design your day accordingly. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Work in sprints. High-intensity work,
     directed at one thing. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Emotion matters. Human beings feel. Building
     something that changes an industry or the world requires you to make
     people feel something.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Failure is overrated. You don’t learn as
     much as people say you do and typically over-allocate importance to
     decisions that weren't that bad. Get up, go again, and avoid it at all
     costs. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Play games where you have a competitive
     advantage. The bet big.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Losing everything is not as bad as you think
     it is. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>When investing early stage, back people over
     ideas. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Saying no is usually more important than
     saying yes. No is a function of honing focus. Focus is very important when
     building a company.</span></li>

     or illness so don’t act accordingly. </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
     font-family:"Helvetica Neue"'>Choose your friends. Most people's
     friendships come from geographical or situational proximity. This can mean
     you have low-quality friends. High-quality friendships are a strong
     forward indicator of a fulfilled and happy life.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;
